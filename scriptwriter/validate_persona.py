"""soul.md weak-model validation harness — the "does the spec hold on a cheap brain?" test.

Builds the REAL chat persona prompt (chat.build_system_prompt — SOUL + STYLE +
examples) and runs a handful of off-the-cuff, in-domain questions through the FREE
chat() seam (Gemini). The idea from soul.md: if a weak model can stay in character
from the spec alone, the spec is concrete enough. Where it goes generic, hedgy, or
off-voice, the SOUL/STYLE is too vague — tighten and re-run.

Questions below are deliberately NOT drawn from soul/examples/, so this tests
generalization, not recall.

Run (free Gemini brain):
    cd scriptwriter
    MARLOW_LLM=gemini ../venv/bin/python validate_persona.py
